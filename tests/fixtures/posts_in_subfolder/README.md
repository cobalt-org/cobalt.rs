# Test for different blog layouts

## posts inside a single directory

All blog posts reside inside a single directory.

## posts inside some folders

For example there can be one folder per year. This makes managing of blog posts easier.

## one folder per post

There is one folder per blog post. Especially useful if there are many associated files
to one blog post (pictures, source files, ...)
