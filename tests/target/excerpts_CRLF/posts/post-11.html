  <h2>Reference-style links immediately below first block do not resolve</h2>
  <p>
    <p>References are placed immediately below the first paragraph:
[30][] [31][] [32][] [33][]
[30]: /0
[31]: /1
[32]: /2
[33]: /3</p>
<p>Note that this is at it should be, as the markdown implementations I've tried
(including CommonMark) do not render the above links (when the post is rendered
individually).</p>
